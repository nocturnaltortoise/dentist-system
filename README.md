# TO DO:
##Frontend
- let the user switch between weeks on the calendar - not sure how best to do this - need to be able to re render the calendar
- subscribe/unsubscribe to healthcare plan button on patient profile
- list treatments on patient profile
- show total cost owed on patient profile
- allow editing of total cost owed
- "Record when a patient has paid their outstanding bill, such that their latest treatments have been paid for, and the total cost owed is now zero." - need to display this on the patient profile probably, so need an input box for this date.
- record visit dialog - in progress - needs some kind of dialog to record type of treatment, cost
